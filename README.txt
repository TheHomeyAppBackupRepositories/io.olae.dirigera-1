Control your devices connected to IKEA Dirigera from Homey.

This is a work-in-progress app and support for additional devices will be done over time.

Current state is that the hub can be added to Homey but no devices are supported yet. This version is intended to be a test-release to help verify that adding and maintaining a connection to the hub is stable.
